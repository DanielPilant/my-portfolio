export const aboutMe = `
I am a second-year Software Engineering student with a strong passion for building impactful products and clean, scalable systems. 
Alongside my academic studies, I lead a student tech community (DEVLEV), gaining hands-on experience in leadership, teamwork, and event organization.

My technical experience includes developing mobile apps in Flutter, creating a custom ray tracing graphics engine in Java, 
and exploring areas such as computer networks, operating systems, and information security.

What sets me apart is my combination of technical depth, leadership skills, and creativity. 
I love tackling complex challenges, sharing knowledge with peers, and driving projects from concept to delivery.

I am eager to contribute my skills in software development, problem solving, and collaboration to a team that values innovation and impact.
